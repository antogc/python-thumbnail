# Serverless Python thumbnail generator 
 This is a Serverless sample application. The app is composed by several components: lambda functions, s3 bucket, dynamoDB and API Gateway. The baisc idea is to be able to generate thumbnial images for new images uploaded to a s3 bucket. 

 Once the thumbnail is generated and pushed to the same S3 bucket, some Metadata will be stored in a DynamoDB. Metadata is accesible throught an API Gateway. 

## Usage

### Deployment

In order to deploy the example, you need to run the following command:

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-python-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-python-project-dev (112s)

functions:
  hello: aws-python-project-dev-hello (1.5 kB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can invoke the deployed function by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\", \"input\": {}}"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```bash
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{\"message\": \"Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!\", \"input\": {}}"
}
```

### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include third-party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).
